            The signs had been there for years. At first, only the hyper-paranoid and conspiracy theorists could see the patterns forming, and - like all prophets - they were dismissed and belittled. Fringe theory scientists and obscenely rich corporate think-tanks were next to follow, and by the time the government, the everyman, the world as a whole began paying attention, it was far too late.

The incidents grew in both size and strangeness: people with no history of violence committing mass murders; plants growing at an extraordinary rate in one field while in the next all life withered and died; inexplicable earthquakes shaking the globe; a town frozen in time.

            Kairos Technologies was offering something different - a new, untested but unique technology that claimed to offer not only the best chance to survive the coming apocalypse, but to skip the worst of the grim years that would inevitably follow in its aftermath: Cryo-Stasis. The facility known as Trinity Falls was risky, experimental - but perhaps your best hope.
